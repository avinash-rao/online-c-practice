Given a number n, find the ordered prime signatures and find the number of divisor of n.
Any positive integer, ‘n’ can be expressed in the form of its prime factors. If ‘n’ has p1, p2, … etc. as its prime factors, then n can be expressed as :
n = {p_1}^{e1} * {p_2}^{e2} * ...
Arrange the obtained exponents of the prime factors of ‘n’ in non-decreasing order. The arrangement thus obtained is called the ordered prime signature of the positive integer ‘n’.

Input:
The first line contains an integer T, the number of test cases. For each test case, there is an integer n.

Output:
For each test case, the output is ordered prime signature and in next line, the total number of divisor of n. 

Constraints:
1<=T<=100
2<=n<=10^6

Example:
Input
2
20
13
Output
1 2
6
1
2

Explanation

1.20 = 2^2 * 5^1,  ordered prime signature of 20 = { 1, 2 } and divisor are 1,2,4,5,10,20 i.e. 6.

2. 13=131 , ordered prime signature of 13 is {1} and divisor are 1 & 13 i.e. 2
